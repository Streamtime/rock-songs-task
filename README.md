A task for potential Streamtime developers

You'll likely need to reference http://backbonejs.org/ to solve some of these questions.

1) There's a bug in the code which is preventing the list from appearing on the page. Fix it.

2) Modify the code to sort the list by play count, from most played to least played.

3) Implement the search box, so that whenever a key is entered (or deleted) from the search box, the list instantly filters down to only show the songs and albums that contain the full search query, ignoring case.
