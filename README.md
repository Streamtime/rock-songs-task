Rock Songs
=======================

We've created this problem to evaluate how developers tackle a real-world problem. The task should take up to 2 hours for a mid-level front-end developer. We don't want you to spend too much time on it, so if you can't complete it within 2 hours feel free to leave a comment in your code describing where you had trouble with and how you would tackle the problem if you had more time.

If you've stumbled across this and want to work at [Streamtime](http://streamtime.net) feel free to submit it too. Even if we're not looking at the time, it doesn't hurt to have a chat to see what we have available.

## The Task

Included in this repository is an [index.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Streamtime/rock-songs-task/master/index.html) file and a [classic_rock.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Streamtime/rock-songs-task/master/classic_rock.json) file. The page gets a list of classic rock songs from the json file and displays them in a table on the page. There is also a CSS file, but you don't need to worry about that. Your task is to modify the `index.html` file to solve the problems listed below. Remember to also rename the header of the page to include your name.

1) There's a bug in the code which is preventing the list from appearing on the page. Fix it.

2) Modify the code to sort the list by play count, from most played to least played.

3) Implement the search box, so that whenever a key is entered (or deleted) from the search box, the list instantly filters down to only show the songs and albums that contain the full search query, ignoring case.

Note: Have a look at [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) to learn more about the javascript framework being used here.

## Submission

Rename the parent directory of these files to include your name, then zip or tar.gz it.
Please email us your solution along with your CV to developers@streamtime.net.
